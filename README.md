# Physically constrained generative models


Langevin sampling subject to hard constraints using Augmented Lagrangian algorithms.

## Code structure

Samplers are located in `samplers.py`. Physical systems with their distributions are defined as classes in `systems/`. Constraints are defined as a class `constraint.py`.

## Example

See example scripts.
